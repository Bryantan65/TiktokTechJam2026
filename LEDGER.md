# Experiment ledger

One line per experiment, read in full by the agent every iteration. Full
records in `logs/iterations/NNN.json`; the code for each is `solutions/NNN_*.py`.

`valid` is the **mean** validation primary across seeds; `+/-` is its standard
deviation across those seeds. `delta` is against the reproduced official
baseline (**0.6015**); a result counts only at **>= +0.002** (the official
epsilon). Two rows closer together than their `+/-` have not been told apart.

| # | parent | hypothesis | valid | +/- | delta | verdict | by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | - | control: official FM ported to PyTorch, pointwise BCE. 3-seed mean. | 0.6014 | 0.0002 | -0.0001 | noise | human |
